Toy project, to experiment with `algorithms` and `functional programming` paradigms.
I intend it as a learning experience, to familiarize myself with the intricacies of these problems - and their elegant solutions.

It's partly based on [Coursera's Algorithms, Part I](https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partI), but includes other exercises as well.
