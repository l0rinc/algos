Toy project, to experiment with `algorithms` and `functional programming` paradigms via `Scala`/`Clojure`.

It's based on the lectures for [Coursera's Algorithms, Part I](https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partI).
Since the course only accepts `Java` homeworks, these sources can't easily be reused - they're not meant to be.

I intend it as a learning experience, through which I may genuinely appreciate the intricacies of these problems - and their elegant solutions.
