Toy project, to experiment with `algorithms`, `Scala`, and `functional programming` paradigms.


It's based on the lectures for [Coursera's Algorithms, Part I](https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partI).
Since the course only accepts `Java` files, these homeworks can't easily be reused - they're not meant to be.

I mean it as a learning experience, through which I may genuinely appreciate the intricacies of these problems - and their elegant solutions.
